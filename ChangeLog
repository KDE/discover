1.1:
====

- Features:
  * Introducing the Muon Software Center, an easy to use Application-centric
    package manager for the common man.
  * Introducing the "muon-updater" program, an update-centric GUI
  * Added an update notifier
  * The download view has been revamped, now supporting per-item progress,
    as well as displaying the size for each item
  * Add a new "Residual Config" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows packages
    that still have purgeable config files laying around.
  * Add a new "Installed (auto-removable)" filter to the filters pane. This filter shows
    packages that were automatically installed that no longer have any installed
    dependents. (Basically, what apt-get autoremove would show)
  * The Technical Details tab now displays the package's origin
  * Added a progress bar to Muon's statusbar to show Xapian indexing update progress.
  * Improved startup time
  * The contents of the "Installed Files" package tab are now sorted alphabetically
    (BKO: #253751)
  * Implemented sorting the package list by status and by requested changes
  * Canonical-supported packages now have a K/Ubuntu emblem on the icon in the package
    view
  * A "Save Installed Packages List" feature has been added, allowing you to make a list
    of all installed packages that can be read by Muon or Synaptic on another computer.
  * Added an option to configure whether or not a package's recommended packages are
    considered as dependencies.
  * Added an option to configure how often APT autocleans cached package files.
  * Enable/disable the "update" and "apply" buttons based on network availability

- Optimizations:
  * Avoid a l10n reverse-lookup for package status by using the UserRoles available to 
    us in QStandardItem to store the QApt::Package::State, and emitting this state when 
    passing it to the PackageView

- Bugfixes:
  * Spacing improvements in the details tabs.
  * Disable the reinstall button for non-reinstallable items, such as non-downloadable
    and/or locally-installed packages. (BKO: #254449)
  * Fix a bug with the new DownloadModel where items from previous downloads would 
    remain if the user cancelled the download
