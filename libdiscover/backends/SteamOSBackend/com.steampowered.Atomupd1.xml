        updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are vardicts that include the following keys:

            <term>variant s</term>

        VersionsAvailableLater:

        Map of available update IDs (i.e. version number) to their keys and
        values. These updates can't be directly installed because they require
        a base system version that is newer than the current one.
        It is an empty map if either there aren't any available
        later updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are the same as for `VersionsAvailable`,
        plus additional vardicts with the following keys:
        <variablelist>

            <term>requires s</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Version ID that must be installed before this update.
            </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        Please note that here the key `estimated_size` represents the estimated
        download size, under the assumption that the update will be performed
        with a system running the version specified in the `requires` key.
