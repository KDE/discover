        UpdatesAvailable:

        Map of available update Build IDs to their keys and values.
        It is an empty map if either there aren't any available
        updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are vardicts that include the following keys:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>variant s</term>

    <!--
        UpdatesAvailableLater:

        Map of available update IDs (i.e. version number) to their keys and
        values. These updates can't be directly installed because they require
        a base system version that is newer than the current one.
        It is an empty map if either there aren't any available
        later updates or if `CheckForUpdates` has not been called yet.

        The values of this map are the same as for `UpdatesAvailable`,
        plus additional vardicts with the following keys:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>requires s</term>
            <listitem><para>
              Version ID that must be installed before this update.
            </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        Please note that here the key `estimated_size` represents the estimated
        download size, under the assumption that the update will be performed
        with a system running the version specified in the `requires` key.

        CurrentVersion:

        The user-facing version of the OS, suitable for display in user
        interfaces, for example 3.4.9. Internally, this behaves more like
        a branch than a version number: there can be several release-candidates
        for the same user-facing version.
        To avoid potentially showing in the UI an update to the same user-facing
        version, it is recommended to include the build ID alongside it.

        CurrentBuildID:

        String that uniquely represents the OS Build ID of the image that is

        Build IDs for the same version can be compared like any other version
        number. Comparing Build IDs for different versions will instead only
        tell you the release order and not which one has the latest features.
